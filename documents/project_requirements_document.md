# Project Requirements Document (PRD) for ContractFlow

## 1. Project Overview

ContractFlow is a web-based platform built for small businesses to manage the entire lifecycle of their contracts. The platform simplifies daily operations by centralizing contract management, automating key reminders, and providing actionable insights to help users grow their business. At its core, ContractFlow tackles the challenge of inconsistent contract handling and the risk of missed deadlines by offering a structured, role-based approach to contract management.

The platform is being built to modernize contract workflows while ensuring data security and compliance. Our key objectives include enabling easy search and retrieval of contracts, integrating with popular e-signature services, and delivering clear, actionable reporting for business performance. Success will be measured by smooth user onboarding, the robustness of role-based access, and the overall efficiency improvements in contract handling and compliance.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Defining and implementing clear user roles (Administrator, Manager, Reviewer, Contributor, Viewer) with specific permissions.
*   **Centralized Contract Database:** A searchable repository with full-text search and filtering options.
*   **Contract Lifecycle Management:** Creation, editing, approval workflows, version tracking, and change history.
*   **Pre-built and Customizable Templates:** Providing baseline templates that users can customize and save for future use.
*   **E-Signature Integration:** Seamless integration with multiple e-signature platforms like DocuSign, Adobe Sign, RightSignature, and PandaDoc.
*   **Automated Reminders/Notifications:** Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, and in-app) for renewals, expirations, and obligations.
*   **Reporting Tools:** Ability to generate and export reports in CSV and PDF formats, including support for scheduled reports.
*   **Subscription and Billing:** Tiered subscription models with a free trial period, billing integration via Stripe.
*   **User Registration and Authentication:** Primary authentication using Supabase auth with optional enhancement via Clerkdev.

### Out-of-Scope

*   **Mobile App Development:** The initial release is web-based only.
*   **Extensive Custom Branding:** No detailed custom branding (logo, color palette) is provided beyond a clean, minimalistic aesthetic.
*   **Advanced AI Features Beyond Content Generation:** While optional AI integrations using GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet are considered for content generation or handling user queries, deep AI-powered analytics is not included.
*   **Extensive Offline Capabilities:** This version will rely on an internet connection and does not include offline functionality.
*   **Complex Workflow Customizations:** Advanced workflow customizations that deviate significantly from the standard contract lifecycle process will be planned for later iterations.

## 3. User Flow

A new user starts by accessing the ContractFlow website and is greeted with a clean, modern registration page. Registration is smooth and simple, utilizing Supabase for basic authentication, with the option of enhanced flows via Clerkdev if needed. After registering with an email and password, the user receives a confirmation email followed by an onboarding guide that explains the key features and benefits of the system. This introduction ensures users understand where to go next and how to navigate their new dashboard.

Once registered, the user is directed to a personalized dashboard designed around their role. Administrators see detailed controls for billing, user management, and overall configuration. Managers, Reviewers, Contributors, and Viewers each see a tailored view highlighting the contracts and functionalities relevant to their position. From the dashboard, users can navigate to the centralized contract repository for search and management, utilize pre-built templates for creating contracts, and set up or receive multi-channel notifications about important dates. The intuitive navigation and clear layout ensure users experience a logical, step-by-step progression through contract creation, review, approval, signing, and reporting.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Constraints:**

    *   The application is targeted at small businesses, so role-based access is kept simple yet effective.
    *   The solution is web-based only; no native mobile applications in the first release.
    *   Integration with third-party APIs (e-signature providers and Stripe) is subject to their availability and rate limits.
    *   Dependencies on Supabase availability, and optional reliance on Clerkdev for specific authentication features.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   Users have reliable internet connections for accessing the web-based platform.
    *   Small businesses will prefer a streamlined, all-in-one contract management solution over using multiple tools.
    *   The provided tech stack and tools (Vite, React, Supabase, Stripe) will sufficiently meet the performance and security needs.
    *   Minimal custom branding is acceptable, sticking with a clean and professional design using neutral colors and modern fonts.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits & Integration Hurdles:**

    *   Third-party integrations, especially with e-signature providers and Stripe, may come with rate limits.
    *   Mitigation: Implement caching strategies and error handling to manage API calls smartly.

*   **User Role Complexity:**

    *   Balancing role-based access without over-complicating the user management system could be challenging.
    *   Mitigation: Start with clearly defined roles and simple hierarchies, then iterate based on user feedback.

*   **Data Security Compliance:**

    *   Ensuring compliance with strict data regulations (GDPR, SOC 2) while maintaining usability can be complex.
    *   Mitigation: Schedule regular audits, and incorporate security as a priority in every development phase.

*   **Performance Under Load:**

    *   As the contract repository grows, search performance might drop.
    *   Mitigation: Optimize database queries and plan for scalability in the Supabase setup from the start.

*   **Notification System Deliverability:**

    *   Multi-channel notification systems (email, SMS, in-app) can have varied deliverability and latency.
    *   Mitigation: Use proven third-party providers for notifications and include fallback mechanisms to ensure timely delivery.
