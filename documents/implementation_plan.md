Below is the step-by-step implementation plan for ContractFlow structured into five phases.

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  **Install Tools:**

    *   Verify that Node.js v20+ is installed on your development machine. If not, install the latest stable version of Node.js.

2.  **Initialize React Project with Vite:**

    *   Create a new React project with TypeScript and Vite by running:

    ```
    npm create vite@latest contractflow -- --template react-ts
    ```

    *   This provides a modern, fast development environment with hot module replacement.

3.  **Configure Tailwind CSS:**

    *   Install and configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS:
    
    ```
    npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
    
    *   Update the Tailwind configuration in `tailwind.config.ts` and include Tailwind directives in `src/index.css`.

4.  **Set Up UI Component Libraries:**

    *   Install shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons:
    
    ```
    npm install @radix-ui/react-* lucide-react
    ```
    
    *   Configure shadcn UI components using the components.json file.

5.  **Initialize Git Repository:**

    *   Create a Git repository with `main` and `dev` branches and apply branch protection rules.

6.  **Integrate Stripe Billing:**

    *   On the subscription page, integrate Stripe billing for subscription management.

7.  **Integration Testing:**

    *   End-to-end test registration, role-based login, contract creation, template customization, e-signature initiation, notification sending, and subscription processing.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  **Frontend Deployment Setup:**

    *   Configure deployment settings for the Vite React application on your preferred platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
    *   Ensure that environment variables (Supabase URL/keys, Stripe keys) are properly set.

2.  **Supabase Production Setup:**

    *   Migrate the database schema to the Supabase production instance.

3.  **Configure CI/CD Pipeline:**

    *   Set up CI/CD to build and deploy the frontend and backend integrations.

4.  **Set Up Cloud Environment Variables:**

    *   Ensure environment variables for Supabase, Stripe, and optional Clerkdev are set in the deployment environment.

5.  **Deployment Validation:**

    *   Once deployed, perform live tests including user registration, role-based dashboard loading, contract CRUD operations, e-signature processes, notifications, and billing.

**Note:** Throughout the implementation ensure to adhere strictly to design and technical specifications outlined in the PRD. Validate every step using appropriate testing tools (unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests) to confirm correct behavior and compliance with requirements.

This plan provides an unambiguous, step-by-step guide for building ContractFlow.
