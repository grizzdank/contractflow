Below is the step-by-step implementation plan for ContractFlow structured into six phases, with an emphasis on architecture, clean code, security, and scalability.

## Phase 0: Architecture and Design Principles

1.  **Layered Architecture Design:**

    *   Define a clear layered architecture with separation of concerns:
        *   **Presentation Layer**: UI components, pages, and layouts
        *   **Application Layer**: Business logic, workflows, and service interfaces
        *   **Domain Layer**: Core business entities, rules, and value objects
        *   **Infrastructure Layer**: External services, data access, and technical implementations
    *   Document the architecture with diagrams and explanations in `documents/architecture.md`

2.  **Code Organization and Standards:**

    *   Establish coding standards and documentation requirements:
        *   Set up ESLint and Prettier with strict rules
        *   Define JSDoc comment standards for all public functions and components
        *   Create README files for major directories explaining purpose and patterns
    *   Set up directory structure to reflect the layered architecture:
        *   `/src/pages`: Page components (presentation layer)
        *   `/src/components`: Reusable UI components (presentation layer)
        *   `/src/features`: Feature-specific components and logic (presentation/application layer)
        *   `/src/services`: Business logic and service interfaces (application layer)
        *   `/src/domain`: Business entities and rules (domain layer)
        *   `/src/lib`: Infrastructure implementations (infrastructure layer)
        *   `/src/utils`: Utility functions and helpers

3.  **Security Framework:**
