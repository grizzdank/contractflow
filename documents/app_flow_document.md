# ContractFlow - App Flow Document

## Introduction

In ContractFlow, small businesses can manage the entire contract lifecycle with ease and efficiency. This web-based platform is designed to centralize contract storage, automate key reminders, and provide actionable insights that help businesses stay organized and compliant. The application incorporates role-based access so that each user, whether an Administrator, Manager, Reviewer, Contributor, or Viewer, sees only the functionalities that are relevant to their role. With a clean and modern design, ContractFlow is built using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, while the backend leverages Supabase for authentication and storage along with integrations like Stripe for billing and various e-signature platforms. The integrated approach ensures that users experience a holistic flow from onboarding to everyday operations without missing a step.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

The journey begins when a user lands on the ContractFlow website. A clean and inviting landing page explains the key benefits of the platform followed by a modern registration form where new users can sign up. For authentication, the system relies on Supabase auth with an option for enhanced flows using Clerkdev if needed. New users register by entering their email and password and then receive a confirmation email ensuring the validity of their account. After confirmation, a guided onboarding sequence provides an introduction to key features such as contract management, role-based access, and reminders. In addition to the sign-up flow, users have simple options to sign in, sign out, and recover their password using a straightforward form that captures email addresses and sends recovery links. This process is designed to be user-friendly and secure while ensuring that even users who are not technically inclined can easily join and navigate the system.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once users log in, they are directed to a personalized dashboard that reflects their role. Whether a user is an Administrator, Manager, Reviewer, Contributor, or Viewer, the home page is tailored to display relevant data and actions. The dashboard features prominent navigation menus at the top and/or side of the screen, allowing easy access to contract repositories, templates, reminders, reporting tools, and account management. For users with administrative rights, additional panels for billing and user management are visible. This home screen serves as the central hub from which all major functionalities are accessed, ensuring that users understand the flow and find what they need quickly.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

From the main dashboard, users can navigate to every core feature with smooth page transitions. In the contract management hub, users find a centralized repository where they can search for contracts using a robust full-text search and multiple filtering options. The experience includes a seamless flow from searching for a contract to viewing its details, editing content based on permissions, and tracking historical versions and approval workflows. Users can also access a library of pre-built contract templates that they can customize and save for repeated use. When a contract is ready for signing, the user has the option to initiate an e-signature process, choosing from integrated platforms such as DocuSign, Adobe Sign, RightSignature, or PandaDoc. Alongside document editing, the platform offers automated multi-channel notifications via email, SMS, and in-app alerts. This notification system is closely tied into the contract tracking feature; as users set reminders for important dates, the system automatically guides them to the corresponding sections of the application to review, approve, or update contracts.

## Settings and Account Management

ContractFlow offers a consolidated account management section where users can easily update their personal information, change their passwords, and configure notification preferences. For users involved in subscription and billing decisions, especially administrators, there is a dedicated panel to view subscription details, manage billing information, and review payment history integrated with Stripe. Role management and access configurations are also handled here, allowing Administrators and Managers to invite new users and assign them appropriate roles. Once changes are made, users can return seamlessly to their dashboard or the contract repository, ensuring that management tasks do not disrupt the overall workflow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the application, error handling is implemented to ensure that disruptions are minimal and users are clearly informed of any issues. When a user enters invalid data during registration, contract creation, or editing, friendly error messages are displayed to indicate what needs to be corrected. In cases of network connectivity issues or system downtime, users encounter clear fallback pages that explain the situation and offer options to retry later or contact support. Attempts to access restricted actions prompt informative alerts that explain the encountered permission issues. By providing these error states and alternative pathways back to a safe zone (typically the main dashboard), the system ensures that users can easily recover from unexpected situations and continue their workflow without losing context.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

ContractFlowâ€™s journey starts with an easy and secure sign-up process that welcomes new users with onboarding instructions and guides them to a role-based dashboard. The flow from the main dashboard to every core function, including contract management, e-signature integrations, notifications, and reporting, is designed to be cohesive and logical. In the settings area, users manage personalized configurations while administrators handle billing and role management with ease. Error states are clearly communicated and provide simple recovery options so that disruptions are minimal. Overall, ContractFlow offers small businesses a dependable and clear path from sign-up to daily operational excellence in managing contract lifecycles, ensuring that every detail is connected and every user journey is complete.
